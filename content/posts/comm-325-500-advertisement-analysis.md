Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to apply the knowledge you have learned over the semester by picking an advertisement and analyzing what persuasive strategies were used. By understanding and being able to identify the persuasive strategies used in advertisements you will be able to better discern what the companies or organizations are trying to do, what they failed to do, and whether this was done effectively. It will also help you decide whether you would be interested in working in the communications field and use your knowledge learned from this class to create advertisements, marketing materials, fundraising campaigns, etc.

Assignment:

* Pick a print or video advertisement (any domain: health, politics, advertising, etc.)
* Analyze the advertisement for:
	* theoretical model(s)/concept(s) that are used (1-3)
		* i.e. Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), Gain/Loss Framing, Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM)
	* additional persuasive strategies (2-4)
		* i.e. two-sided messaging, celebrity endorsement, appeal to social norms, source credibility factors, evidence, emotional appeal, etc.
* Create a word document (1-2 double-spaced pages + ad) and include the following:
	* Name of advertisement
	* Type of advertisement print or video. For the video: include url for video. For print: include an image of the print ad at the end of the analysis.
	* Theoretical model(s)/concept(s): identify the theoretical models in bold font, analyze theoretical concepts and thoroughly describe how they are used and not used in the advertisement, and whether the theory was used effectively in this ad.
	* Additional persuasive strategies: identify the theoretical model and or concepts and thoroughly describe how they are used in the advertisement
