This will be a running list of things I plan to buy. :P

- [Record sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CYKRVRW)
- [Shower caddy that can fit 4 bars of soap and 4 bottles of soap](https://www.amazon.com/InterDesign-Hanging-Shower-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/B003OBY5NU/)
- [Lamp that can fit by my couch](https://www.target.com/p/valencia-led-floor-lamp-brass-includes-energy-efficient-light-bulb-project-62-8482/-/A-54550861#)
- [Standing dock for my iPhone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LD85OH6)
- [Bike headlight](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-commuter-bike-lights/) -- It's probably a lot safer to bike around at night with proper lighting.
- [Laptop Stand](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-laptop-stands/)
- [Byword](https://www.bywordapp.com/) -- For writing this blog :)
- [Tom Bihn's Synik 22](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/backpacks/products/synik-22) -- I like smallish backpacks and Tom Bihn makes the best backpacks.
