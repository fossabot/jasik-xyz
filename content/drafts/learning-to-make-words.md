Well, here goes. I am going to post a one hundred word article every day until Natalie's birthday, March 22nd. It will certainly be interesting. 

I am on my sixth day at Texas A&M University, and it's lots of fun. I've made many friends and I'm really enjoying the recreational center. My first night here was hard though. My family has always been ridiculously close. We've always done everything together. And I mean everything. That night I realized that my time with my family was ending. I sobbed my face off. While I was crying, I also felt for my cousins whose dad has just died, and my friends who just had a second miscarriage.
