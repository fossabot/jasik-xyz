<blockquote>
<p>this is James Laffrey’s recipe that I’ve written down for deliciousness</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>ingredients</h2>

<ul>
	<li>muffin tins</li>
	<li>glass with mouth wider than muffin tin cups</li>
	<li>6 lbs of ground meat (a mix of beef and lamb)</li>
	<li>3 lbs of frozen carrots and peas</li>
	<li>1 hunk of garlic</li>
	<li>salt, pepper, thyme</li>
	<li>1 beef stock or aus jus</li>
	<li>pre-made pie crust</li>
	<li>instant potatoes</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ol>
	<li>brown the ground beef</li>
	<li>add your onions and cook until they are translucent. </li>
	<li>add pepper and salt and thyme. and a whole chunk of garlic. </li>
	<li>add frozen peas and carrots to the mix. </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to make the meat filling the night before, stop here and refrigerate it.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="5">
	<li>if you refrigerated the meat filling, heat it up and be sure to heat up all of the fat embedded in it. If there isn’t enough, just add some butter.</li>
	<li>add flour to the meat filling and coat everything thoroughly.</li>
	<li>then add any beef stock you have. Gatsby used aus jus. Use whatever you want though.</li>
	<li>now take a glass that has a larger mouth than your muffin tins and use it to cut out pie crusts.</li>
	<li>brush these with butter and then flour to prevent them from sticking as you set them on a plate to the side.</li>
	<li>poke the bottom of each crust with a fork to prevent bubbles.</li>
	<li>bake them in the oven at 350°F for 5 minutes, blind baking the crust.</li>
	<li>once the crusts are done, take your meat filling and fill to about 2/3 of the crust. Add a 1/4 cup scoop of instant potatoes to the top and bake at 350°F for about 8 minutes.</li>
	<li>Tada! You now have amazing mini shepherd’s pies</li>
